-   Right now, when a player joins a room, they get back the current players array but they don't get their player ID. Need to fix that

- Lobby implementation is more or less complete, we need to move players from lobby namespace to game namespace
    * We might achieve that by copying the lobby room data to a new game room, and have the players connect from there
