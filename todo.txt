* Implement socket in Lobby.js, listen to events in server
socket requirements:
    - if user leaves the lobby, a socket event will be emitted and lobby will be updated
    - if user joins the lobby, a socket event will be emitted and lobby will be updated
    - if admin leaves the lobby, a socket event will be emitted and lobby (game) will be destroyed
    - if lobby is full, a socket event will be emitted and game will start
    ALL THIS WHILE MAKING SURE EACH ROOM IS SEPERATE WHEN LISTENING TO EVENTS (Try and do it with room ID/code ?)
